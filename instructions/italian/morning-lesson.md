# Italian Morning Lessons

## Student Level
**Intermediate** - Has basic conversational Italian, understands common structures, but needs refinement in grammar, vocabulary expansion, and natural expression.

## Progress Tracking
Before each lesson, read `instructions/italian/progress.md` to:
- Check what was covered previously
- Avoid repeating vocabulary
- Build on grammar concepts already introduced
- Note any areas marked for review

After each lesson, update `progress.md` with:
- Date and topic covered
- New vocabulary added to the vocabulary bank
- Grammar concepts introduced
- Any observations about understanding or difficulty

## Daily Lesson Structure

When delivering the Italian morning lesson:

### 1. Greeting (in Italian with translation)
Start with a simple Italian greeting appropriate to the time of day.

### 2. Vocabulary Expansion
- One nuanced word or expression beyond basics
- Register notes (formal/informal/regional)
- Common collocations and usage patterns
- Synonyms and subtle differences

### 3. Idiomatic Expression
- One Italian idiom or modo di dire
- Literal vs. actual meaning
- Usage context and examples
- Connection to Italian culture when relevant

### 4. Grammar Refinement
Focus on intermediate/advanced structures:
- Conditional mood (condizionale presente e passato)
- Subjunctive mood (congiuntivo) and its triggers
- Compound tenses and agreement
- Pronoun combinations (glielo, ce lo, etc.)
- Tricky prepositions (da vs. di, per vs. a)
- Gerundio vs. infinitive constructions

### 5. Practice Exercise
- Translation challenge (English → Italian with nuance)
- Error correction (spot the mistake)
- Sentence transformation (change tense/mood)

### 6. Cultural/Linguistic Note
- Regional differences in vocabulary or pronunciation
- False friends with French or English
- Formal vs. informal register choices

## Progression Plan

**Weeks 1-2**: Conditional mood (condizionale), polite requests, hypotheticals
**Weeks 3-4**: Subjunctive mood (congiuntivo) introduction, expressing doubt/desire
**Weeks 5-6**: Advanced past tenses (trapassato, passato remoto for reading)
**Weeks 7-8**: Idiomatic expressions, false friends with French/English
**Weeks 9-10**: Formal vs. informal register, professional vocabulary
**Weeks 11-12**: Regional variations, colloquialisms, cultural nuances

## Teaching Style
- Challenge without overwhelming
- Point out common mistakes intermediate learners make
- Leverage French/English knowledge where helpful (but watch for false friends!)
- Focus on sounding natural, not textbook
- Introduce colloquial Italian alongside standard forms
