*   Deep Latent Variable Models for Unstructured Data (with Philine Widmer & Elliott Ash) (Paper available upon request)
*   Neural Ideal Point Models (with Hugo Subtil & Philine Widmer) (Paper available upon request)
*   Relatio: Text Semantics Capture Political and Economic Narratives (with Elliott Ash & Philine Widmer) (Political Analysis, 2023) (published version, working paper, replication files)
